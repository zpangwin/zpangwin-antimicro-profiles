for advanced setup:

this is intended to overlay on top of the game's existing vanilla mapping to provide extra functionality without needing to still use the keyboard as much.

The changes are only for certain buttons. First, let's describe what those buttons do in the game before AntiMicroX / remaps are introduced.

| Xbox button (Default game mappings) | Context(s)     | Description |
|:-----------------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| Guide button                        | all            | not used    |
| Left  stick (click)                 | all            | not used    |
| Right stick (click)                 | all            | cycle map modes (off, mini, full) |
| Y button                            | pause menu     | show controls |
| Right bumper / right shoulder       | controls menu  | switch between keyboard and gamepad controls |  
| Y button                            | pause menu     | show controls |
| Left  bumper / left  shoulder       | world          | crouch |  
| Right bumper / right shoulder       | world          | sprint or roll |  
| A button                            | binoculars     | toggle xray mode |
| X button                            | xray mode      | lock target |
| X button                            | dialog         | skip current line of dialog |
| Left  trigger                       | world          | aim    |
| Right trigger                       | world          | fire weapon |
| back button                         | world          | weapon selection screen |
| start button                        | world          | pause menu |
| A button                            | world          | jump |
| B button                            | world          | inventory/notes menu |
| X button                            | world          | interact / contextual action |
| Y button                            | world          | drop item in backpack |
| dpad up                             | world          | switch weapon to UZA-SH1 (uzi pistol) |
| dpad right                          | world          | switch weapon to HAWK-MK8 (energy pistol) | 
| dpad down                           | world          | switch weapon to LN-DUO 500 (grenade launcher) |
| dpad left                           | world          | switch weapon to FT 74-X (flame thrower) |

from this, we can see guide button and left stick are completely open / free to use without any conflicts.

Everything else, the single-button click is still interpretted by the game even if we map extra functionality to double-click or hold so a lot of these like start/back/b-button won't work (since the keypress would happen after a menu that would block said keypress) or might be inconvenient (e.g. left/right triggers and right should already have single-tap and hold functionality defined and shooting when double-tapping or holding would not be good).

- A (jump) does require holding / more precise tapping sometimes for longer/shorter jet-pack assists when jumping, if you are trying to be precise. So it's not really a good candidate for extra mappings either.

- Y only has an effect when an item is equipped in the hand slot and even then, it simply puts the item back into the inventory.

- X only has an effect when interating with something (reloading happens automatically or can sometimes be triggered on single-click but that isn't really inconvenient anyway)

- LB (crouching) is a toggle and easily undone. Ditto w D-pad weapon selections.


Mouse and keyboard bindings that don't have any mappings/selection on the default controller layout (e.g. require you to equip via inventory or use kb):

| Keyboard shortcut | Action |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| F1                | Gaamsavv (save game menu) |
| F2                | Medikit       | 
| F3                | E.V.D. (binoculars) | 
| F4                | PPS (Invisibility)  | 
| F5                | UBIK-0A (Hologram decoy) | 
| F6                | Dynamite  | 
| F7                | CLAPR-T (remote detonator for dynamite) | 
| F8                | THNDR-STP33 (proximity detonator) | 
| F9                | Health Plant  | 
| F10               | Hoti (Twon-ha lure) |
| 1                 | switch weapon to HK-P12 (starting pistol) |
| 3                 | switch weapon to SLNT-B (sniper dart rifle) |

Given this, here's what I'm mapping things to:
